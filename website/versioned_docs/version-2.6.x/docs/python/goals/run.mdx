Run a `pex_binary` target.

---

To run an executable/script, simply use `./pants run` on a `pex_binary` target, like this:

```bash
$ ./pants run project/app.py
```

or

```bash
$ ./pants run project:app
```

You may only run one target at a time.

The program will have access to the same environment used by the parent `./pants` process, so you can set environment variables in the external environment, e.g. `FOO=bar ./pants run project/app.py`. (Pants will auto-set some values like `$PATH`).

Start a Python remote debugging session in PyCharm, say on port 5000.\n\n2. Add the following code at the point where you want execution to pause and connect to the debugger:\n\n```\nimport pydevd_pycharm\npydevd_pycharm.settrace('localhost', port=5000, stdoutToServer=True, stderrToServer=True)\n```\n\nRun your executable with `./pants run` as usual. \n\nNote: The first time you do so you may see some extra dependency resolution work, as `pydevd-pycharm` has now been added to the binary's dependencies, via inference. If you have dependency inference turned off in your repo, you will have to manually add a temporary explicit dependency in your binary target on the `pydevd-pycharm` target.",

To pass arguments to the script/executable, use `--` at the end of the command, like this:

```bash
$ ./pants run project/app.py -- --arg1 arg2 arg3
