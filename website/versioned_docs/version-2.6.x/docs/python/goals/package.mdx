Create a deployable artifact.

---

The `package` goal creates an artifact that can be deployed or distributed.

The exact type of artifact depends on the type of target the goal is invoked on.

You can run `./pants package ::` to build all artifacts in your project. Pants will filter to only the relevant targets.

  "title": "Benefit of Pants: artifacts only include your true dependencies",
  "body": "Because Pants understands the dependencies of your code, and the dependencies of those dependencies, the generated artifact will only include the exact code needed for your package to work. This results in smaller, more focused packages."

  "title": "Benefit of Pants: easily write automated tests of your packaging pipeline",
  "body": "You can depend on a package target in a `python_tests` target through the `runtime_package_dependencies` field. Pants will run the equivalent of `./pants package` beforehand and copy the built artifact into the test's chroot, allowing you to test things like that the artifact has the correct files present and that it's executable.\n\nThis allows you to test your packaging pipeline by simply running `./pants test ::`, without needing custom integration test scripts.\n\nSee [test](doc:python-test-goal) for more information."

  "title": "Creating a PEX file from a `pex_binary` target"
}
[/block]
Running `package` on a `pex_binary` target will create an executable [PEX file](doc:pex-files).

The PEX file will contain all the code needed to run the binary, namely:
- All Python code and resources the binary transitively depends on.
- The resolved 3rd-party Python dependencies (sdists, eggs and wheels) of all targets the binary transitively depends on.

The PEX metadata will include:
- The entry point specified by the `pex_binary` target.
- The intersection of all interpreter constraints applicable to the code in the Pex. See [Interpreter compatibility](doc:python-interpreter-compatibility).

You can also tweak many options, such as if the binary is zip safe. Run `./pants help pex_binary`.

### The `entry_point` field

The entry point sets the behavior for what happens when you run `./dist/my_app.pex`, such as if it runs a particular script or launches an app. You must specify the `entry_point` field for every `pex_binary`.

For the first two approaches, Pants will use [dependency inference](doc:targets), which you can confirm by running `./pants dependencies path/to:app`. You can also manually add to the `dependencies` field.

#### Approach #1, a file name

You can specify a file name, which Pants will convert into a well-formed entry point. Like with the `sources` field, file paths are relative to the BUILD file, rather than the build root.
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "# The default `sources` field will include `main.py`.\npython_library()\n\n# Pants will convert the entry point to `helloworld.main`.\npex_binary(\n  name=\"app\",\n  entry_point=\"main.py\",\n)\n\n# You can also specify the function to run.\npex_binary(\n  name=\"app_with_func\",\n  entry_point=\"main.py:my_func\",\n)",
      "language": "python",
      "name": "helloworld/BUILD"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
This approach has an added benefit that you can use file arguments, e.g. `./pants package helloworld/main.py`, rather than needing to use target addresses like `./pants package helloworld:app`.

#### Approach #2, explicit `entry_point`

You can directly specify the entry point in the format `path.to.module` or `path.to.module:my_func`. This allows you to use an entry point for a third-party requirement or the Python standard library.
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "# The default `sources` field will include `main.py`.\npython_library()\n\npex_binary(\n  name=\"app\",\n  entry_point=\"helloworld.main\",\n)\n\n# You can also specify the function to run.\npex_binary(\n  name=\"app_with_func\",\n  entry_point=\"helloworld.main:my_func\",\n)\n\n# You can specify third-party requirements and the std lib.\npex_binary(\n  name=\"3rdparty_app\",\n  entry_point=\"bandit:main\",\n)",
      "language": "python",
      "name": "helloworld/BUILD"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
Unlike Approach #1, this does not work with file arguments; you must use the target address, like `./pants package helloworld:app`.

#### Approach #3, no entry point

Set `entry_point="<none>"` to leave off an entry point. This will create a PEX that behaves similarly to a virtual environment's Python interpreter; for example, running `./dist/my_app.pex` will open a Python REPL with all of the first party code and third-party requirements included.

Note that Pants cannot use dependency inference in this case, so you must manually add to the `dependencies` field if you want to include first-party code and/or third-party requirements in the binary.

### Examples

    {
      "code": "$ ./pants package helloworld/main.py\n\n17:36:42 [INFO] Wrote dist/helloworld/helloworld.pex",

We can also build the same Pex by using the address of the `pex_binary` target, as described [here](doc:targets).
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "$ ./pants package helloworld:app\n\n17:36:42 [INFO] Wrote dist/helloworld/helloworld.pex",

Running `package` on a `python_distribution` target will create a standard setuptools-style Python distribution, such as an sdist or a wheel. See [Building Distributions](doc:python-distributions) for details.

See [Resources and archives](doc:resources) for how to create a zip or tar file with built binaries and/or loose files in it. This is often useful when you want to create a PEX binary using the `pex_binary` target, and bundle it with some loose config files.

If you have the `pants.backend.awslambda.python` backend enabled, then you can use the `package` goal to build AWS Lambdas. See [AWS Lambda](doc:awslambda-python) for more details.
