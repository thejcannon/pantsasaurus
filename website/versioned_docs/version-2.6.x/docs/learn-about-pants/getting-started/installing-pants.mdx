# Prerequisites

To run Pants, you need:

- One of: 
  - Linux (x86_64)
  - MacOS (Intel or Apple Silicon, 10.15 Catalina or newer)
  - Microsoft Windows 10 with WSL 2
- Python 3.7+ discoverable on your `PATH`
- Internet access (so that Pants can fully bootstrap itself)

# System-specific notes

## Linux

  "type": "warning",
  "body": "On Ubuntu you may need to run:\n`apt install -y python3-dev python3-distutils`.",

  "type": "warning",
  "title": "Alpine Linux is not yet supported",
  "body": "Pants for Linux is currently distributed as a manylinux wheel. Alpine Linux is not covered by manylinux (it uses MUSL libc while manylinux requires glibc), so at present Pants will not run on Alpine Linux. \n\nIf you need to run Pants on Alpine, [let us know](doc:community), so we can prioritize this work. Meanwhile, you can try [building Pants yourself](#building-pants-from-sources) on Alpine."

{
  "type": "warning",
  "title": "Linux on ARM is not yet supported",
  "body": "Pants for Linux is currently only distributed as an x86_64 wheel.\n\nIf you need to run Pants on ARM, please [comment on this issue](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/12183) so we can prioritize this work. Meanwhile, you can try [building Pants yourself](#building-pants-from-sources) on ARM."

## MacOS
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "body": "We publish a macOS `arm64` wheel for Python 3.9. Make sure you have Python 3.9 discoverable on your `$PATH`, e.g. via Homebrew or Pyenv, and an updated version of the `./pants` runner script.\n\nGiven the lack of CI infrastructure for Apple Silicon, this support is best-effort and there may a delay in publishing this wheel compared to our normal releases.\n\nIf you have Python code, you may need to [set your interpreter constraints](doc:python-interpreter-compatibility) to Python 3.9+, as many tools like Black will not install correctly when using earlier Python versions.\n\nSome users have also had success with earlier versions using Rosetta by running `arch -x86_64 pants`. Note that Pants's cache currently does not work properly when switching between architectures; you will need to run `rm -rf ~/.cache/pants` when switching.",

## Microsoft Windows

  "body": "Pants runs on Windows 10 under the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):\n\n- Follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to install WSL 2. \n- Install a recent Linux distribution under WSL 2 (we have tested with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS).\n- Run `sudo apt install unzip python3-dev python3-distutils python3-venv gcc` in the distribution.\n- You can then run Pants commands in a Linux shell, or in a Windows shell by prefixing with `wsl `."

# Creating the launch script

Pants is invoked via a launch script named `./pants` , saved at the root of the repository. This script will install Pants and handle upgrades.

First, set up a minimal `pants.toml` config file to instruct the script to download the latest 2.6 release:

```bash
printf '[GLOBAL]\npants_version = "2.6.1"\n' > pants.toml
```

Then, download the script:

```bash
curl -L -o ./pants https://static.pantsbuild.org/setup/pants && \
chmod +x ./pants
```

Now, run this to bootstrap Pants and to verify the version it installs:

```bash
./pants --version
```

We currently distribute Pants for Linux (x86_64) and MacOS.

If you need to run Pants on some other platform, such as Linux on ARM or Alpine Linux, you can try building it yourself by checking out the [Pants repo](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants), and running `./pants package src/python/pants:pants-packaged` to build a wheel.
