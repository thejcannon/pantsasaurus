Our approach to semantic versioning + time-based releases.

---

Pants follows semantic versioning, along with using regular time-based dev releases. We follow a strict [Deprecation policy](doc:deprecation-policy).

Stable releases occur roughly every month. They have been vetted through at least one release candidate.

Stable releases are named with the major, minor, and patch version—with no suffix. For example, `2.1.0` or `2.2.1`.

Any new patch versions will only include backward-compatible bug fixes, and will not have new features or new deprecations. Patch versions must have also had at least one release candidate.

`rc` releases are on track to being stable, but may still have some issues.

Release candidates are named with the major, minor, and patch version, and end in `rc` and a number. For example, `2.1.0rc0` or `2.1.0rc1`.

Release candidates should only contain bug fixes; they should generally not include new features or new deprecations. (Exception for `rc0`, which can include the same changes as a normal `dev` release.)

  "title": "When is a release \"stable\" enough?",
  "body": "A stable release cannot be created until a minimum of 5 business days from the first `rc0` release. Typically, during this time, there will be multiple release candidates to fix any issues discovered.\n\nA stable release can be created two business days after the most recent release candidate if there are no more blockers."

`dev` releases are weekly releases that occur directly from the `main` branch, without the additional vetting that is applied to stable releases and release candidates. Usually, these are released on Friday or Monday.

Dev releases help to ensure a steady release cadence from `master` by filling in the gaps between the more time consuming stable releases.

Dev releases are named with the major, minor, and patch version, and end in `.dev` and a number. For example, `2.1.0.dev0` or `2.1.0.dev1`.

Dev releases can include any changes, so long as they comply with the [Deprecation policy](doc:deprecation-policy).
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "title": "How many dev releases until starting a release candidate?",
  "body": "Usually, we release 3-4 dev releases before switching to the first release candidate `rc0`. This means we usually release `dev0`, `dev1`, `dev2`, sometimes `dev3`, and then `rc0`.\n\nWe try to limit the number of changes in each stable release to make it easier for users to upgrade. If the dev releases have been particularly disruptive, such as making major deprecations, we may start a release candidate sooner, such as after `dev1`."
