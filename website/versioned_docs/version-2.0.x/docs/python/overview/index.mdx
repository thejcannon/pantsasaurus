The Python ecosystem has a great many tools for various features, and Pants installs, configures and invokes those tools for you, while taking care of orchestrating the workflow, caching results, running concurrently, and so on.

Pants currently supports the following goals and features for Python:

There are also [goals](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/project-introspection) for querying and understanding your dependency graph, and a robust [help system](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/command-line-help).  We're adding support for additional tools and features all the time, and it's straightforward to [implement your own](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/plugins-overview).
