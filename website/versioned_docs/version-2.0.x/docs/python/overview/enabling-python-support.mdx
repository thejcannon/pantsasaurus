Enable the Python [backend](doc:enabling-backends) like this:
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "[GLOBAL]\n...\nbackend_packages = [\n  'pants.backend.python'\n]\n",
      "language": "toml",
      "name": "pants.toml"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
You should now see some new goals available:
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "$ ./pants help goals\n...\n\npackage       Create a distributable package.\n\nrepl          Open a REPL with the specified code loadable.\n\n...\n\nrun           Runs a binary target.\n...\n\ntest          Run tests.",
      "language": "text",
      "name": "Shell"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "title": "Have content in your `__init__.py` files?",
  "body": "Pants automatically uses all relevant `__init__.py` files, even if dependency inference does not include the files and you don't add it to the `dependencies` fields of your targets.\n\nThis works if you have empty `__init__.py` files, like most Python projects do; but if you have actual code in your `__init__.py` files, you should turn on this option in your `pants.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[python-infer]\ninits = true\n```\n\nThis option will cause Pants to infer \"proper\" dependencies on any ancestor `__init__.py` file. If you run `./pants dependencies project/util/foo.py`, you should see `project/__init__.py` and `project/util/__init__.py` show up. This will ensure that any of the `dependencies` of your `__init__.py` files are included."

  "type": "danger",
  "title": "Using Python 3.8's `:=` walrus operator? Tweak the `./pants` script",
  "body": "For dependency inference to work properly when using Python 3.8+ syntax, you need to tweak the `./pants` script to run the tool with Python 3.8, rather than 3.6 or 3.7. Change the function `set_supported_python_versions` to only use 3.8: https://github.com/pantsbuild/setup/blob/2f079cbe4fc6a1d9d87decba51f19d7689aee69e/pants#L135-L141. If you do not have that function in your `./pants` script, you likely need to update the script by copying the file from the above GitHub link.\n\nThis will be fixed in 2.2 so that Pants can always parse your code, regardless of what interpreter Pants is run with."

{
  "type": "warning",
  "title": "macOS users: you may need to change interpreter search paths",
  "body": "By default, Pants will look at both your `$PATH` and—if you use Pyenv—your `$(pyenv root)/versions` folder when discovering Python interpreters. Your `$PATH` likely includes the system Pythons at `/usr/bin/python` and `/usr/bin/python3`, which are known to have many issues like failing to install some dependencies.\n\nPants will prefer new Python versions, like 3.6.10 over 3.6.3. Because macOS system Pythons are usually very old, they will usually be ignored.\n\nHowever, if you run into issues, you can set the `interpreter_search_paths` option in the `[python-setup]` scope:\n\n```toml\n[python-setup]\ninterpreter_search_paths = [\n    # This will use all interpreters in `$(pyenv root)/versions`.\n    \"<PYENV>\",\n     # Brew usually installs Python here. \n    \"/usr/local/bin\",\n]\n```\n\nSee [here](doc:python-interpreter-compatibility#changing-the-interpreter-search-path) for more information."
