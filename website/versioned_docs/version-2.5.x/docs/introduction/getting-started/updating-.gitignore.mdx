Ignoring Pants's byproduct files.

---

If you use Git, we recommend adding these lines to your top-level `.gitignore` file:
[block:code]
{
"codes": [
{
"code": "# Pants workspace files\n/.pants.d/\n/dist/\n/.pids\n/.pants.workdir.file_lock*",
"language": "text",
"name": ".gitignore"
}
]
}
[/block]

[block:callout]
{
"type": "info",
"title": "FYI: your `.gitignore` is used to auto-populate the option `pants_ignore`",
"body": "The `pants_ignore` option tells Pants which files to avoid looking at. Occasionally, you will want to ignore something with Git, but still want Pants to work on the file. See [Troubleshooting / common issues](../../using-pants/troubleshooting-common-issues/index.mdx) for how to do this."
}
[/block]
