To run Pants, you need:

- One of: 
  - Linux (x86_64)
  - MacOS (Intel or Apple Silicon, 10.15 Catalina or newer)
  - Microsoft Windows 10 with WSL 2
- Python 3.7+ discoverable on your `PATH`
- Internet access (so that Pants can fully bootstrap itself)

Alpine Linux is not covered by manylinux (it uses MUSL libc while manylinux requires glibc), so at present Pants will not run on Alpine Linux. \n\nIf you need to run Pants on Alpine, [let us know](doc:community), so we can prioritize this work. Meanwhile, you can try [building Pants yourself](#building-pants-from-sources) on Alpine."

### MacOS

  "body": "We publish a macOS `arm64` wheel for Python 3.9. Make sure you have Python 3.9 discoverable on your `$PATH`, e.g. via Homebrew or Pyenv, and an updated version of the `./pants` runner script.\n\nGiven the lack of CI infrastructure for Apple Silicon, this support is best-effort and there may a delay in publishing this wheel compared to our normal releases.\n\nIf you have Python code, you may need to [set your interpreter constraints](doc:python-interpreter-compatibility) to Python 3.9+, as many tools like Black will not install correctly when using earlier Python versions.\n\nSome users have also had success with earlier versions using Rosetta by running `arch -x86_64 pants`.",
