How to build Docker images containing artifacts built by Pants

---

Docker images typically bundle build artifacts, such as PEX files, wheels, loose files, and so on, with other runtime requirements, such as a Python interpreter.

Pants [makes it easy to embed the artifacts Pants builds into your Docker images](https://blog.pantsbuild.org/pants-pex-and-docker/), for easy deployment.

To use Pants's Docker support you must enable the appropriate backend:
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "backend_packages = [\n  ...\n  \"pants.backend.experimental.docker\",\n  ...\n]",
      "language": "toml",
      "name": "pants.toml"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
We expect the Docker backend to graduate out of the "experimental" area soon!

}
[/block]
A Docker image is built from a recipe specified by a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/). When you build Docker images with Pants, instead of running `docker` on the Dockerfile directly, you let Pants do that for you.

Pants uses [`docker_image`](doc:reference-docker_image) [targets](doc:targets) to indicate which Dockerfiles you want Pants to know about, and to add any necessary metadata. 

You can generate initial BUILD files for your Docker images, using [tailor](doc:create-initial-build-files):

```
❯ ./pants tailor
Created src/docker/app1/BUILD:
  - Add docker_image target docker
Created src/docker/app2/BUILD:
  - Add docker_image target docker
```

Or you can add them manually, such as:
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "docker_image(name=\"docker\")",
      "language": "python",
      "name": "src/docker/app1/BUILD"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
Alternatively you may provide the Docker build instructions inline in your BUILD file as [`instructions`](doc:reference-docker_image#codeinstructionscode) on your `docker_image` if you don't want to create a `Dockerfile`.
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "docker_image(\n  name=\"docker\",\n  instructions=[\n    \"FROM python:3.8\",\n    \"RUN ..\",\n  ]\n)",
      "language": "python",
      "name": "src/docker/app1/BUILD"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

[block:callout]
{
  "type": "warning",
  "title": "The `docker_image` `instructions` field",
  "body": "Each `docker_image` uses a `Dockerfile` referred to by the `source` field, unless you have provided a value to the `instructions` field.\n\nWhen using the `instructions` field, make sure that the default value for `source` does not match a file, or there will be a conflict which information to use."
}

[block:api-header]
{
  "title": "Adding dependencies to your `docker_image` targets"
}
[/block]
A Dockerfile executes in a _context_ - a set of files that the commands in the Dockerfile can reference, e.g., by copying them into the image).

When you run `docker` directly, the context is usually a directory within your repo. That directory must contain the Dockerfile (typically at the root of the context) and any files that the build requires. If those files are themselves the product of a build step, or if they are sources from elsewhere in the repo, then you have to copy them into the context.

Pants, however, takes care of assembling the context for you. It does so using the dependencies of the `docker_image` target. 

A [`docker_image`](doc:reference-docker_image) can depend on loose files belonging to [`file` / `files` targets](doc:resources#files), and on artifacts packaged from a variety of targets, such as [`pex_binary`](doc:reference-pex_binary) , [`python_distribution`](doc:reference-python_distribution), [`archive`](doc:reference-archive), or any other target that can be built via the [package](doc:reference-package) goal.

The context is assembled as follows:

* The sources of `file` / `files` targets are assembled at their relative path from the repo root.
* The artifacts of any packageable targets are built, as if by running `./pants package`, and placed in the context using the artifact's `output_path` field.
     - The `output_path` defaults to the scheme `path.to.directory/tgt_name.ext`, e.g. `src.python.helloworld/bin.pex`.


### Dependency inference

When you `COPY` PEX binaries into your image, the dependency on the `pex_binary` target will be inferred, so you don't have to add that explicitly to the list of `dependencies` on your `docker_image` target.

For example, the `pex_binary` target `src/python/helloworld/bin.pex` has the default `output_path` of `src.python.helloworld/bin.pex`. So, Pants can infer a dependecy based on the line `COPY src.python.helloworld/bin.pex /bin/helloworld`.
[block:api-header]
{
  "title": "Building a Docker image"
}
[/block]
You build Docker images using the `package` goal:

```
❯ ./pants package path/to/Dockerfile
```

### Build arguments

To provide values to any [build `ARG`s](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg) in the Dockerfile, you can list them in the `[docker].build_args` configuration option which will apply for all images, and list any image specific build args in the field `extra_build_args` for the `docker_image` target.

The build args use the same syntax as the [docker build --build-arg](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#set-build-time-variables---build-arg) command line option: `VARNAME=VALUE`, where the value is optional, and if left out, the value is taken from the environment instead.
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "[docker]\nbuild_args = [\n  \"VAR1=value1\",\n  \"VAR2\"\n]",
      "language": "toml",
      "name": "pants.toml"
    },
    {
      "code": "docker_image(\n  name=\"docker\",\n  extra_build_args=[\"VAR1=my_value\", \"VAR3\"]\n)",
      "language": "python",
      "name": "example/BUILD"
    },
    {
      "code": "FROM python:3.8\nARG VAR1\nARG VAR2\nARG VAR3=default\n...",
      "language": "dockerfile",
      "name": "example/Dockerfile"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
### Target build stage

When your `Dockerfile` is a multi stage build file, you may specify which stage to build with the [`--docker-build-target-stage`](doc:reference-docker#section-build-target-stage) for all images, or provide a per image setting with the `docker_image` field [`target_stage`](doc:reference-docker_image#codetarget_stagecode).
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "FROM python:3.8 AS base\nRUN <install required tools>\n\nFROM base AS img\nCOPY files /",
      "language": "dockerfile"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
```
❯ ./pants package --docker-build-target-stage=base Dockerfile
```

### Build time secrets

Secrets are supported for `docker_image` targets with the [`secrets`](doc:reference-docker_image#codesecretscode) field. The defined secrets may then be mounted in the `Dockerfile` as [usual](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/#new-docker-build-secret-information).
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "docker_image(\n  secrets={\n    \"mysecret\": \"mysecret.txt\",\n  }\n)",
      "language": "python",
      "name": "BUILD"
    },
    {
      "code": "FROM python:3.8\n\n# shows secret from default secret location:\nRUN --mount=type=secret,id=mysecret cat /run/secrets/mysecret\n\n# shows secret from custom secret location:\nRUN --mount=type=secret,id=mysecret,dst=/foobar cat /foobar\n",
      "language": "dockerfile"
    },
    {
      "code": "very-secret-value",
      "language": "text",
      "name": "mysecret.txt"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "title": "Secret file path",
  "body": "Secrets should not be checked into version control. Use absolute paths to reference a file that is not in the project source tree. However, to keep the BUILD file as hermetic as possible, the files may be placed within the project source tree at build time for instance, and referenced with a path relative to the project root by default, or relative to the directory of the BUILD file when prefixed with `./`.\n\nSee the example for the [`secrets`](doc:reference-docker_image#codesecretscode) field."
}
[/block]
### Build Docker image example

This example copies both a `file` and `pex_binary`:
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "file(name=\"msg\", source=\"msg.txt\")\n\ndocker_image(\n    name=\"docker\",\n    dependencies=[\":msg\", \"src/python/hw:bin\"],\n)\n",
      "language": "python",
      "name": "src/docker/hw/BUILD"
    },
    {
      "code": "FROM python:3.8\nENTRYPOINT [\"/bin/helloworld\"]\nCOPY src/docker/hw/msg.txt /var/msg\nCOPY src.python.hw/bin.pex /bin/helloworld",
      "language": "dockerfile",
      "name": "src/docker/hw/Dockerfile"
    },
    {
      "code": "Hello, Docker!",
      "language": "text",
      "name": "src/docker/hw/msg.txt"
    },
    {
      "code": "python_sources(name=\"lib\")\n\npex_binary(name=\"bin\", entry_point=\"main.py\")",
      "language": "python",
      "name": "src/py/hw/BUILD"
    },
    {
      "code": "import os\n\nmsg = \"Hello\"\nif os.path.exists(\"/var/msg\"):\n    with open(\"/var/msg\") as fp:\n        msg = fp.read().strip()\n\nprint(msg)",
      "language": "python",
      "name": "src/py/hw/main.py"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
```
❯ ./pants package src/docker/hw/Dockerfile
[...]
18:07:29.66 [INFO] Completed: Building src.python.hw/bin.pex
18:07:31.83 [INFO] Completed: Building docker image helloworld:latest
18:07:31.83 [INFO] Built docker image: helloworld:latest
```
[block:api-header]
{
  "title": "Running a Docker image"
}
[/block]
You can ask Pants to run a Docker image on your local system with the `run` goal:

```
❯ ./pants run src/docker/hw/Dockerfile
Hello, Docker!
```

Any arguments for the Docker container may be provided as pass through args to the `run` goal, as usual. That is, use either the `--args` option or after all other arguments after a separating double-dash:

```
❯ ./pants run src/docker/hw/Dockerfile -- arguments for the container
Hello, Docker!
```

To provide any command line arguments to the `docker run` command, you may use the `--docker-run-args` option:

```
❯ ./pants run --docker-run-args="-p 8080 --name demo" src/docker/hw/Dockerfile 
```

As with all configuration options, this is not limited to the command line, but may be configured in a Pants rc file (such as `pants.toml`) in the `[docker].run_args` section or as an environment variable, `PANTS_DOCKER_RUN_ARGS` as well.
[block:api-header]
{
  "title": "Publishing images"
}
[/block]
Pants can push your images to registries using `./pants publish`:

```shell
❯ ./pants publish src/docker/hw:helloworld
# Will build the image and push it to all registries, with all tags.
```

See [here](doc:tagging-docker-images) for how to set up registries.

To configure the Docker binary, set `[docker].env_vars` in your `pants.toml` configuration file. You use that key to list environment variables such as `DOCKER_CONTEXT` or `DOCKER_HOST`, that will be set in the environment of the `docker` binary when Pants runs it. Each listed value can be of the form `NAME=value`, or just `NAME`, in which case the value will be inherited from the Pants process's own environment.
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "[docker]\nenv_vars = [\n  \"DOCKER_CONTEXT=pants_context\",\n  \"DOCKER_HOST\"\n]",
      "language": "toml",
      "name": "pants.toml"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

[block:api-header]
{
  "title": "Linting Dockerfiles with Hadolint"
}
[/block]
Pants can run [Hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) on your Dockerfiles to check for errors and mistakes:

```
❯ ./pants lint src/docker/hw/Dockerfile
```

This must first be enabled by activating the Hadolint backend:
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "[GLOBAL]\nbackend_packages.add = [\"pants.backend.experimental.docker.lint.hadolint\"]",
      "language": "toml",
      "name": "pants.toml"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
