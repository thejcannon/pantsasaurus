## Slack

The best place to get help is the Pants project's Slack workspace. You can join using [this link](https://join.slack.com/t/pantsbuild/shared_invite/zt-d0uh0mok-RLvVosDiX6JDpvStH~bFBA).

Feel free to optionally introduce yourself in `#welcome`. You can use `#general` to ask questions or to share feedback.

## Mailing list

You can join the `pants-devel@googlegroups.com` mailing list [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pants-devel). This is used mostly for announcements and for us to solicit user feedback.

## GitHub

If you discover a bug with Pants or have a feature request, feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues). Please check first if a similar issue has already been filed; if it has, please comment so that we know to bump the issue in priority.
