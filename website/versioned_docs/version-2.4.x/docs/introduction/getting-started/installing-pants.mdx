# Prerequisites

To run Pants, you need:

- Linux (x86_64) or macOS.
- Python 3.7+ discoverable on your `PATH`.
- Internet access (so that Pants can fully bootstrap itself).

# Creating the launch script

Pants is invoked via a launch script named `./pants` , saved at the root of the repository. This script will install Pants and handle upgrades.

First, set up a minimal `pants.toml` config file to instruct the script to download the latest 2.4 release:

```bash
printf '[GLOBAL]\npants_version = "2.4.2"\n' > pants.toml
```

Then, download the script:

```bash
curl -L -o ./pants https://pantsbuild.github.io/setup/pants && \
chmod +x ./pants
```

Now, run this to bootstrap Pants and to verify the version it installs:

```bash
./pants --version
```

We currently distribute Pants for Linux (x86_64) and MacOS.

If you need to run Pants on some other platform, such as Linux on ARM, or Alpine Linux, you can try building it yourself by checking out the [Pants repo](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants), and running `build-support/bin/release.sh -q`.
