The commands Pants runs.

---

Pants commands are known as _goals_, such as `test` and `lint`.

To satisfy a goal, Pants will use cached data whenever possible, and perform work to compute the relevant data (and cache it) when necessary. Pants will perform work concurrently as much as possible, using all the local cores, and/or any remote build executors, it has access to.

# Which goals are available?

Pants is an extensible system, so the exact goals that are available depend upon which [backends](doc:enabling-backends)  are enabled.

To see the current list of goals, run:

```bash
./pants help goals
```

For example, if you don't yet have any backends installed, you should see:
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "./pants help goals\n\nGoals\n-----\n\ncount-loc     Count lines of code.\n\ndependees     List all targets that depend on any of the input files/targets.\n\ndependencies  List the dependencies of the input files/targets.\n\nfiledeps      List all source and BUILD files a target depends on.\n\nfilter        Filter the input targets based on various criteria.\n\nlist          Lists all targets matching the file or target arguments.\n\npackage       Create a distributable package.\n\nroots         List the repo's registered source roots.\n\nvalidate      Validate sources against regexes.\n\nUse `./pants help $goal` to get help for a specific goal.",

# Running goals

Let's try running a goal:
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "$ ./pants roots\n3rdparty/python\nsrc/assets\nsrc/python",
      "language": "text",
      "name": "Shell"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

# Goal arguments

Some simple goals—such as the `roots` goal—do not require arguments. But most goals require some arguments to work on. 

For example, to run the `count-loc` goal, which counts lines of code in your repository, you need to provide a set of files and/or targets to run on:
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "$ ./pants count-loc '**'\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nLanguage                 Files     Lines   Blanks  Comments     Code Complexity\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nPython                      13       155       50        22       83          5\nBASH                         2       261       29        22      210         10\nJSON                         2        25        0         0       25          0\nPlain Text                   2        43        1         0       42          0\nTOML                         2        65       14        18       33          0\n...",
      "language": "text",
      "name": "Shell"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "title": "Quoting file patterns",
  "body": "Note the single-quotes around the file pattern `'**'`. This is so that your shell doesn't attempt to expand the pattern, but instead passes it unaltered to Pants."
}
[/block]
## File arguments vs. target arguments

**Note: ** Typically you can just use file arguments, and not worry about targets.

Goal arguments can be of one of two types:

- *File arguments*: file paths and/or globs.
- *Target arguments*: addresses and/or address globs of [targets](doc:targets).

Any goal can take either type of argument: 

- If a target argument is given, the goal acts on all the files in the matching targets.
- If a file argument is given, Pants will map the file back to its containing target to read any necessary metadata. 

So again, for the most part, you can just use file arguments and not worry about targets!
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "title": "File/target globs",
  "body": "For file arguments, use `'*'` and `'**'`, with the same semantics as the shell. Reminder: quote the argument if you want Pants to evaluate the glob, rather than your shell.\n\nFor target arguments, you can use:\n\n- `dir::`, where `::` means every target in the current directory and recursively in subdirectories.\n- `dir:`, where `:` means every target in that directory, but not subdirectories.\n\nFor example, `./pants list ::` will find every target in your project."
}

[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "title": "Tip: advanced target selection, such as running over changed files",
  "body": "See [Advanced target selection](doc:advanced-target-selection) for alternative techniques to specify which files/targets to run on."
}
[/block]
## Goal options

Many goals also have [options](doc:options) to change how they behave. 

To see if a goal has any options, run `./pants help $goal` or `./pants help-advanced $goal`. See [Command Line Help](doc:getting-help) for more information.

For example:

```
./pants help roots

`roots` goal options
--------------------

List the repo's registered source roots.

Config section: [roots]

  --roots-output-file=<path>
  PANTS_ROOTS_OUTPUT_FILE
  output_file
      default: None
      current value: None
      Output the goal's stdout to this file. If unspecified, outputs to stdout.

  --roots-sep=<separator>
  PANTS_ROOTS_SEP
  sep
      default: \n
      current value: \n
      String to use to separate lines in line-oriented output.
```

You can then use the option by prefixing it with the goal name:

```
./pants --roots-sep=', ' roots
3rdparty/python, src/assets, src/python
```

As a shorthand, if you put the option after the goal, you can leave off the goal name in the flag:

```bash
./pants roots --sep=', '
```
