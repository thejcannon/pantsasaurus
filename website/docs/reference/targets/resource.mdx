title: resource

---

A single resource file embedded in a code package and accessed in a location-independent manner.

Resources are embedded in code artifacts such as Python wheels or JVM JARs. The sources of a `resources` target are accessed via language-specific resource APIs, such as Python's `pkgutil` or JVM's ClassLoader, via paths relative to the target's source root.

## <code>source</code>

<span style="color: purple">
  type:{" "}
  <code>
    str | http_source |
    pants.core.target_types.per_platform[pants.core.target_types.http_source]
  </code>
</span>
<span style="color: green">required</span>

The source of this target.

If a string is provided, represents a path that is relative to the BUILD file's directory, e.g. `source='example.ext'`.

If an `http_source` is provided, represents the network location to download the source from. The downloaded file will exist in the sandbox in the same directory as the target.

`http_source` has the following signature:

    http_source(url: str, *, len: int, sha256: str, filename: str = "")

The filename defaults to the last part of the URL path (e.g. `example.ext`), but can also be specified if you wish to have control over the file name. You cannot, however, specify a path separator to download the file into a subdirectory (you must declare a target in desired subdirectory).

You can easily get the len and checksum with the following command:

    curl -L $URL | tee >(wc -c) >(shasum -a 256) >/dev/null

If a `per_platform` is provided, represents a mapping from platform to `http_source`, where the platform is one of (`linux_arm64`, `linux_x86_64`, `macos_arm64`, `macos_x86_64`) and is resolved in the execution target. Each `http_source` value MUST have the same filename provided.

## <code>dependencies</code>

<span style="color: purple">
  type: <code>Iterable[str] | None</code>
</span>
<span style="color: green">
  default: <code>None</code>
</span>

Addresses to other targets that this target depends on, e.g. `['helloworld/subdir:lib', 'helloworld/main.py:lib', '3rdparty:reqs#django']`.

This augments any dependencies inferred by Pants, such as by analyzing your imports. Use `pants dependencies` or `pants peek` on this target to get the final result.

See [Targets and BUILD files](doc:targets) for more about how addresses are formed, including for generated targets. You can also run `pants list ::` to find all addresses in your project, or `pants list dir` to find all addresses defined in that directory.

If the target is in the same BUILD file, you can leave off the BUILD file path, e.g. `:tgt` instead of `helloworld/subdir:tgt`. For generated first-party addresses, use `./` for the file path, e.g. `./main.py:tgt`; for all other generated targets, use `:tgt#generated_name`.

You may exclude dependencies by prefixing with `!`, e.g. `['!helloworld/subdir:lib', '!./sibling.txt']`. Ignores are intended for false positives with dependency inference; otherwise, simply leave off the dependency from the BUILD file.

## <code>description</code>

<span style="color: purple">
  type: <code>str | None</code>
</span>
<span style="color: green">
  default: <code>None</code>
</span>

A human-readable description of the target.

Use `pants list --documented ::` to see all targets with descriptions.

## <code>tags</code>

<span style="color: purple">
  type: <code>Iterable[str] | None</code>
</span>
<span style="color: green">
  default: <code>None</code>
</span>

Arbitrary strings to describe a target.

For example, you may tag some test targets with 'integration_test' so that you could run `pants --tag='integration_test' test ::` to only run on targets with that tag.
