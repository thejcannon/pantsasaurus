A single Scala source file containing application or library code.

Backend: <span style="color: purple"><code>pants.backend.experimental.scala</code></span>

## `source`

<Field
  type_repr='str'
>
A single file that belongs to this target.

Path is relative to the BUILD file's directory, e.g. `source='example.ext'`.
</Field>

## `dependencies`

<Field
  type_repr='Iterable[str] | None'
  default='None'
>
Addresses to other targets that this target depends on, e.g. `['helloworld/subdir:lib', 'helloworld/main.py:lib', '3rdparty:reqs#django']`.

This augments any dependencies inferred by Pants, such as by analyzing your imports. Use `pants dependencies` or `pants peek` on this target to get the final result.

See [Targets and BUILD files](doc:targets) for more about how addresses are formed, including for generated targets. You can also run `pants list ::` to find all addresses in your project, or `pants list dir` to find all addresses defined in that directory.

If the target is in the same BUILD file, you can leave off the BUILD file path, e.g. `:tgt` instead of `helloworld/subdir:tgt`. For generated first-party addresses, use `./` for the file path, e.g. `./main.py:tgt`; for all other generated targets, use `:tgt#generated_name`.

You may exclude dependencies by prefixing with `!`, e.g. `['!helloworld/subdir:lib', '!./sibling.txt']`. Ignores are intended for false positives with dependency inference; otherwise, simply leave off the dependency from the BUILD file.
</Field>

## `description`

<Field
  type_repr='str | None'
  default='None'
>
A human-readable description of the target.

Use `pants list --documented ::` to see all targets with descriptions.
</Field>

## `experimental_provides_types`

<Field
  type_repr='Iterable[str] | None'
  default='None'
>
Signals that the specified types should be fulfilled by these source files during dependency inference.

This allows for specific types within packages that are otherwise inferred as belonging to `jvm_artifact` targets to be unambiguously inferred as belonging to this first-party source.

If a given type is defined, at least one source file captured by this target must actually provide that symbol.
</Field>

## `jdk`

<Field
  type_repr='str | None'
  default='None'
>
The major version of the JDK that this target should be built with. If not defined, will default to `[jvm].default_source_jdk`.
</Field>

## `main`

<Field
  type_repr='str | None'
  default='None'
>
`.`-separated name of the JVM class containing the `main()` method to be called when executing this target. If not supplied, this will be calculated automatically, either by inspecting the existing manifest (for 3rd-party JARs), or by inspecting the classes inside the JAR, looking for a valid `main` method. If a value cannot be calculated automatically, you must supply a value for `run` to succeed.
</Field>

## `resolve`

<Field
  type_repr='str | None'
  default='None'
>
The resolve from `[jvm].resolves` to use when compiling this target.

If not defined, will default to `[jvm].default_resolve`.
</Field>

## `scalac_plugins`

<Field
  type_repr='Iterable[str] | None'
  default='None'
>
The names of Scala plugins that this source file requires.

The plugin must be defined by a corresponding `scalac_plugin` AND `jvm_artifact` target, and must be present in this target's resolve's lockfile.

If not specified, this will default to the plugins specified in `[scalac].plugins_for_resolve` for this target's resolve.
</Field>

## `skip_scalafmt`

<Field
  type_repr='bool'
  default='False'
>

If true, don't run `scalafmt` on this target's code.
</Field>

## `tags`

<Field
  type_repr='Iterable[str] | None'
  default='None'
>
Arbitrary strings to describe a target.

For example, you may tag some test targets with 'integration_test' so that you could run `pants --tag='integration_test' test ::` to only run on targets with that tag.
