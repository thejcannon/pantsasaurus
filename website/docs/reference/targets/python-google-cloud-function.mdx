A self-contained Python function suitable for uploading to Google Cloud Function.

See [Google Cloud Functions](doc:google-cloud-function-python).

Backend: <span style="color: purple"><code>pants.backend.google_cloud_function.python</code></span>

## <code>handler</code>

<span style="color: purple">
  type: <code>str</code>
</span>
<span style="color: green">required</span>

Entry point to the Google Cloud Function handler.

You can specify a full module like `'path.to.module:handler_func'` or use a shorthand to specify a file name, using the same syntax as the `sources` field, e.g. `'cloud_function.py:handler_func'`.

This is re-exported at `main.handler` in the resulting package to used as the configured handler of the Google Cloud Function in GCP. It can also be accessed under its source-root-relative module path, for example: `path.to.module.handler_func`.

## <code>type</code>

<span style="color: purple">
  type: <code>'event' | 'http'</code>
</span>
<span style="color: green">required</span>

The trigger type of the cloud function. Can either be `'event'` or `'http'`. See https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/python-runtime for reference to `--trigger-http`.

## <code>complete_platforms</code>

<span style="color: purple">
  type: <code>Iterable[str] | None</code>
</span>
<span style="color: green">
  default: <code>None</code>
</span>

The platforms the built PEX should be compatible with.

There must be built wheels available for all of the foreign platforms, rather than sdists.

You can give a list of multiple complete platforms to create a multiplatform PEX, meaning that the PEX will be executable in all of the supported environments.

Complete platforms should be addresses of `file` targets that point to files that contain complete platform JSON as described by Pex (https://pex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/buildingpex.html#complete-platform).

N.B.: only one of this and `runtime` can be set. If `runtime` is set, a default complete platform is chosen, if one is known for that runtime. Explicitly set this to `[]` to use the platform's ambient interpreter, such as when running in an docker environment.

## <code>dependencies</code>

<span style="color: purple">
  type: <code>Iterable[str] | None</code>
</span>
<span style="color: green">
  default: <code>None</code>
</span>

Addresses to other targets that this target depends on, e.g. `['helloworld/subdir:lib', 'helloworld/main.py:lib', '3rdparty:reqs#django']`.

This augments any dependencies inferred by Pants, such as by analyzing your imports. Use `pants dependencies` or `pants peek` on this target to get the final result.

See [Targets and BUILD files](doc:targets) for more about how addresses are formed, including for generated targets. You can also run `pants list ::` to find all addresses in your project, or `pants list dir` to find all addresses defined in that directory.

If the target is in the same BUILD file, you can leave off the BUILD file path, e.g. `:tgt` instead of `helloworld/subdir:tgt`. For generated first-party addresses, use `./` for the file path, e.g. `./main.py:tgt`; for all other generated targets, use `:tgt#generated_name`.

You may exclude dependencies by prefixing with `!`, e.g. `['!helloworld/subdir:lib', '!./sibling.txt']`. Ignores are intended for false positives with dependency inference; otherwise, simply leave off the dependency from the BUILD file.

## <code>description</code>

<span style="color: purple">
  type: <code>str | None</code>
</span>
<span style="color: green">
  default: <code>None</code>
</span>

A human-readable description of the target.

Use `pants list --documented ::` to see all targets with descriptions.

## <code>environment</code>

<span style="color: purple">
  type: <code>str | None</code>
</span>
<span style="color: green">
  default: <code>&#x27;&lowbar;&lowbar;local&lowbar;&lowbar;&#x27;</code>
</span>

Specify which environment target to consume environment-sensitive options from.

Once environments are defined in `[environments-preview].names`, you can specify the environment for this target by its name. Any fields that are defined in that environment will override the values from options set by `pants.toml`, command line values, or environment variables.

You can specify multiple valid environments by using `parametrize`. If `__local__` is specified, Pants will fall back to the `local_environment` defined for the current platform, or no environment if no such environment exists.

## <code>output_path</code>

<span style="color: purple">
  type: <code>str | None</code>
</span>
<span style="color: green">
  default: <code>None</code>
</span>

Where the built asset should be located.

If undefined, this will use the path to the BUILD file, followed by the target name. For example, `src/python/project:app` would be `src.python.project/app.ext`.

When running `pants package`, this path will be prefixed by `--distdir` (e.g. `dist/`).

Warning: setting this value risks naming collisions with other package targets you may have.

## <code>resolve</code>

<span style="color: purple">
  type: <code>str | None</code>
</span>
<span style="color: green">
  default: <code>None</code>
</span>

The resolve from `[python].resolves` to use.

If not defined, will default to `[python].default_resolve`.

All dependencies must share the same value for their `resolve` field.

## <code>runtime</code>

<span style="color: purple">
  type:{" "}
  <code>
    'python310' | 'python311' | 'python37' | 'python38' | 'python39' | None
  </code>
</span>
<span style="color: green">
  default: <code>None</code>
</span>

The identifier of the Google Cloud Function runtime to target (pythonXY). See https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/python-runtime.

In general you'll want to define either a `runtime` or one `complete_platforms` but not both. Specifying a `runtime` is simpler, but less accurate. If you have issues either packaging the Google Cloud Function PEX or running it as a deployed Google Cloud Function, you should try using `complete_platforms` instead.

## <code>tags</code>

<span style="color: purple">
  type: <code>Iterable[str] | None</code>
</span>
<span style="color: green">
  default: <code>None</code>
</span>

Arbitrary strings to describe a target.

For example, you may tag some test targets with 'integration_test' so that you could run `pants --tag='integration_test' test ::` to only run on targets with that tag.
