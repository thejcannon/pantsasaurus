A deployment of Terraform

Backend: <span style="color: purple"><code>pants.backend.experimental.terraform</code></span>

## `root_module`

<Field
  type_repr='str'
>
The Terraform module to use as the root module.

Example: `root_module=":my_module"`
</Field>

## `backend_config`

<Field
  type_repr='str | None'
  default='None'
>
Configuration to be merged with what is in the configuration file's 'backend' block
</Field>

## `dependencies`

<Field
  type_repr='Iterable[str] | None'
  default='None'
>
Addresses to other targets that this target depends on, e.g. `['helloworld/subdir:lib', 'helloworld/main.py:lib', '3rdparty:reqs#django']`.

This augments any dependencies inferred by Pants, such as by analyzing your imports. Use `pants dependencies` or `pants peek` on this target to get the final result.

See [Targets and BUILD files](doc:targets) for more about how addresses are formed, including for generated targets. You can also run `pants list ::` to find all addresses in your project, or `pants list dir` to find all addresses defined in that directory.

If the target is in the same BUILD file, you can leave off the BUILD file path, e.g. `:tgt` instead of `helloworld/subdir:tgt`. For generated first-party addresses, use `./` for the file path, e.g. `./main.py:tgt`; for all other generated targets, use `:tgt#generated_name`.

You may exclude dependencies by prefixing with `!`, e.g. `['!helloworld/subdir:lib', '!./sibling.txt']`. Ignores are intended for false positives with dependency inference; otherwise, simply leave off the dependency from the BUILD file.
</Field>

## `description`

<Field
  type_repr='str | None'
  default='None'
>
A human-readable description of the target.

Use `pants list --documented ::` to see all targets with descriptions.
</Field>

## `tags`

<Field
  type_repr='Iterable[str] | None'
  default='None'
>
Arbitrary strings to describe a target.

For example, you may tag some test targets with 'integration_test' so that you could run `pants --tag='integration_test' test ::` to only run on targets with that tag.
</Field>

## `var_files`

<Field
  type_repr='Iterable[str] | None'
  default='None'
>
A list of files and globs that belong to this target.

Paths are relative to the BUILD file's directory. You can ignore files/globs by prefixing them with `!`.

Example: `var_files=['common.tfvars', 'prod.tfvars']`
