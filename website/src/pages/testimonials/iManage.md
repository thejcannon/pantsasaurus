## Head of Engineering, Legal Transaction Management

## [iManage](https://imanage.com/)

> Over the last year at iManage Closing Folders, we transitioned a mature Django monolith with three accompanying microservices to Pants. Right off the bat, this transition forced us to untangle a convoluted web of dependencies that had emerged in our codebase over the six years it had been actively developed on. Soon after the migration we were able to get significant wins through codesharing between our monolith and microservices.
>
> Additionally, the safety and speed of our deployment process was drastically augmented by Pants ability to build fully self-contained .pex files.
>
> For day-to-day work, Pants has empowered developers to create clear separation of concerns between disparate parts of the application, eliminating unnecessary dependencies and improving stability and maintainability. It has also brought sanity to keeping linting, formatting, third party dependency versioning and python versions consistent across the codebase.
>
> Compared to other build tools, Pants is drastically more approachable for a small team of python developers, making it possible for an early-stage company to lay the groundwork for a maintainable codebase at an early stage. Perhaps most importantly, it is backed by a passionate team who are an absolute joy to work with. I would recommend Pants highly to any team!
